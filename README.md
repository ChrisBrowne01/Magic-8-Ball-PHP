# Magic 8-Ball project using PHP

## Project Overview

The [Magic 8-Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8_Ball) is a popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice.

This is a Magic 8-Ball web application built using PHP. The app allows users to ask a question and get a random answer from the 8-Ball.

## About

In this project, you’ll be creating a function that can answer any *“yes”* or *“no”* question.

![Magic 8-Ball, should I do this project?](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-cpp/conditionals-and-logic/magic8ball.gif "Magic 8-Ball, should I do this project?")

  *"Magic 8-Ball, should I do this project?"*

The answers inside a standard Magic 8-Ball are:

- `It is certain.`
- `It is decidedly so.`
- `Without a doubt.`
- `Yes - definitely.`
- `You may rely on it.`
- `As I see it, yes.`
- `Most likely.`
- `Outlook good.`
- `Yes.`
- `Signs point to yes.`
- `Reply hazy, try again.`
- `Ask again later.`
- `Better not tell you now.`
- `Cannot predict now.`
- `Concentrate and ask again.`
- `Don't count on it.`
- `My reply is no.`
- `My sources say no.`
- `Outlook not so good.`
- `Very doubtful.`

- Your `magic8Ball()` will take in any *“yes”* or *“no”* question (as a string) and give a psychic (random) answer.
